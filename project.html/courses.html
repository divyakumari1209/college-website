                            studies in P.G. as well as in different technical coures like leather technology, polymers
                            and paints, B. Pharma and different management courses. They can also join the jobs as
                            Chemist, Pharmaceutical Companies and the Companies of pains, lacquers etc.

                            P.G.: After completion of the P.G. Course in Chemistry, one can join the research fields
                            related to Pollutions, Drugs, Polymers, etc. They may prefer the teaching jobs also after
                            qualifying NET, B.Ed. etc. The jobs in BARC, Trombay and DRDO may also be joined to carry
                            out the research works in nuclear chemistry and for the development of stealth technology in
                            fighter planes using conducting polymers. Development of medines for cancer, HIV, COVID 19
                            may also be developed by joing the pharmaceutical industry as Research Assocites.
                            Ph.D: Research Works for Ph.D degrees are also carried out on polymers. Research works on
                            Acrylic Polymers help to absorb water and moisture helping agriculture in desert areas and
                            in draught. Acrylic Polymers are also helping in the development of paints and coating
                            materials. Electrically Conducting Polymers are helpful in the preparation of long lasting
                            batteries, better quality of transistor, diode, solar panels and stealth technology of
                            fighter planes. Both types research works are carried out in the Gossner College, Chemistry
                            Department.

                            Psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and the reasons for people’s behavior.

                            It’s not about reading minds but a discipline that includes the study of human behavior. It
                            provides a set of tools and theories for understanding how humans think and learn.

                            By studying psychology one could go into teaching, counseling, writing (of course!), human
                            resources, research, and so on.

                            Psychology provides the tools to become a behavioral trainer, which can prove useful for
                            pets, children, and even significant others.
